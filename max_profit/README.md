# Max Profit
You should find the biggest profit from given array.
Every index in the array represents an hour in a day, and every value in the array represents a stock price. 
The program should return the maximum profit available in the array.
For example:
```javascript
function maxProfit(stockPrices) {
    // Your Code Here
}

var stockPrices = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9];
console.log(maxProfit(stockPrices)); 
// will print 6 (buy for 5 and sell for 11)
```

Notes:
- You can't sell a stock before you buy it.
